So here we were in Piter and went to the apartment that we had booked, it was not far from the city centre. Having dropped off our stuff, we went on a walk around the city centre and grabbed something to eat. Well, actually every afternoon we spent here was pretty much the same. In the evening we would go to any Pub or Bar and killed time there. Yes, killed time because it was not much fun. Maybe it s because the people around weren t much fun.  Of course it was interesting to visit the museums and other sights of the city but I can t say that really left an impression that it was supposed to and all in all, I didn t feel too happy throughout that trip.	0
Having come to Piter, first thing we went to the apartment that we had booked, it was in the city centre, straight in Nevskiy, our window overlooked the beautiful views of Piter, especially in the evening when the sun went down, it was very beautiful.

Every evening we would drive around different places in the city and sure thing, we don t have any clubs or pubs like that back home and I don t think we ever will. The way this city makes you feel is just special.	1
